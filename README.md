# Threads Trend Finder

Desktop app for affiliate marketers who research viral Threads posts and turn high-signal ideas into affiliate product angles. It fetches public Threads content with Playwright, stores posts locally in SQLite, scores viral potential, and uses OpenAI for pain-point and product suggestions.

This app is research-only. It does not render videos, auto-post to TikTok/Reels, create fake engagement, or run aggressive scraping.

## Stack

- Electron main process for desktop shell, IPC, SQLite, Playwright, and OpenAI calls
- Next.js + React + TypeScript renderer
- TailwindCSS dark dashboard UI
- SQLite via `better-sqlite3`
- Playwright Chromium scraper with saved Threads session state
- OpenAI Chat Completions JSON output

## Setup

```bash
npm.cmd install
npm.cmd run scraper:install
copy .env.example .env
npm.cmd run db:init
npm.cmd run dev
```

PowerShell blocks `npm.ps1` on this machine, so use `npm.cmd`.

If Electron is launched from a shell that has `ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=1`, clear it first:

```powershell
$env:ELECTRON_RUN_AS_NODE=$null
npm.cmd start
```

Set `OPENAI_API_KEY` in `.env` or in the app Settings page for live AI analysis. The default model is `gpt-4.1-nano`, the cheapest listed test model for this workflow.

## Threads Session

Use the `Threads Login` button in Settings to open a Playwright browser window and sign in. The browser profile is saved to `data/threads-browser-profile`, and a cookie snapshot is saved to `data/threads-session.json`. Both are local and reused by future fetches, including after rebuilds, unless the `data/` directory is deleted.

## Development Workflow

```bash
npm.cmd run typecheck
npm.cmd run build
npm.cmd run dev
```

`npm.cmd run db:init` rebuilds SQLite for Node, initializes the database, then rebuilds SQLite for Electron. Run `npm.cmd run electron:rebuild` after dependency upgrades that affect Electron, Node, or `better-sqlite3`.

The dev command starts Next.js, watches Electron TypeScript files with `tsup`, waits for both, and launches Electron.

## Core Modules

- `src/server/scraper/threadsScraper.ts`: fetches home, keyword, hashtag, profile, and trending-style search pages.
- `src/server/scoring/trendingScore.ts`: computes a 0-100 score from engagement velocity, replies, reposts, emotional language, controversy, and relatability.
- `src/server/ai/affiliateAnalysisService.ts`: returns emotional trigger, pain point, buying intent, affiliate categories, product ideas, hooks, CTAs, and viral rationale.
- `src/server/db/client.ts`: local SQLite persistence for posts, analysis, saved posts, keywords, and fetch logs.
- `src/electron/main.ts`: IPC boundary between renderer and local Node services.

## Safety Defaults

- Headless scraper uses capped post limits and delay controls from `.env`.
- Saved login state is local only.
- No posting, commenting, liking, bot engagement, or video generation is implemented.
